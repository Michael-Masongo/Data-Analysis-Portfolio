# 🤖 Customer Segmentation & Clustering

## 📝 Project Description

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment mall customers based on their annual income and spending behavior. The goal was to uncover distinct customer groups to support targeted marketing and strategic business decisions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- Python 🐍  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn (KMeans Clustering)

## 📈 Objectives

- Segment customers based on purchasing patterns and income levels  
- Identify profitable customer groups for tailored marketing strategies  
- Visualize the clustering process and outcomes effectively

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Customer Segmentation:** Using K-Means clustering, five distinct customer segments were identified based on annual income and spending scores.  
- **Business Targeting Strategy:** High spenders with mid-to-high income were recognized as prime candidates for premium product campaigns. The predominance of female customers across clusters highlighted the importance of gender-focused marketing.  
- **Visual Analysis:** Scatter plots and the elbow method graph provided clear visualization of customer clusters and helped determine the optimal number of segments.
